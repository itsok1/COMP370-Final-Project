# COMP-370---Final-Project
This project investigates how Volodymyr Zelensky is portrayed in North American news media. Our goal is to understand both the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) and the dominant themes present in major news outlets’ coverage.

# Project Overview
Over 500 news articles mentioning Zelensky were collected from reputable North American sources. Using a combination of open coding, manual annotation, and other methods, we explored:

- How positive or negative the media portrayal of Zelensky is

- What topics journalists focus on when discussing him

- How frequently each topic appears across the dataset
